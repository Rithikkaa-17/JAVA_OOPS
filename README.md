#  Triangle Area Calculator (Java)
This Java program calculates the area of a triangle using Heron’s formula, based on the lengths of its three sides provided by the user.
# Heron’s Formula:
s = (a + b + c) / 2  
Area = √(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
# Features:
1. Takes input for 3 sides of a triangle.

2. Validates if a triangle can be formed.

3. Calculates and displays area if valid.

4. Handles invalid triangle cases.
